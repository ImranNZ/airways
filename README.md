# Airways Technical Exercise

This project was created using CRA and the TypeScript template in an environment using Node.js v19.3.0.

## Assumptions

- Given the points are entered via text input this and the likely number of pairs ranges from 2 to 10, I've made the assumption that a brute force algorithm is fit for purpose.
- If two pairs of points are equally close or equally far, then it is OK to display both of the duplicates.
- Use of Bootstrap is OK.
- Jest tests are used for demonstration, however all test cases may not be covered.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Basic Usage

- Enter the points in the specified format into the input, e.g. 0,1.234 3,8 4,3 10,13.
- Click the Analyze button
- See results in the Characteristics table
